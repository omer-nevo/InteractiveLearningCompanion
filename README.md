The project tackles the issue of Passive Learning, marked by the absence of active engagement in the learning process, which can lead to gaps in knowledge and a misjudgment of one's learning progress (illustrated by the 'Dunning-Kruger' effect).
Our solution is a web app designed as a personalized virtual learning assistant. 
This assistant prompts students with questions tailored to the text they're studying and their previous interactions. It can also respond to questions inputted by the user, indicating whether the answer is found within the document or derived from external data. 
This approach ensures that learners actively participate in their education, enabling a more accurate assessment of their understanding.
